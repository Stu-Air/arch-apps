## Description

This is a Shell script for the automation of installing Arch linux. This is by no means any complete set of all Settings needed for your system and neither is it another "antispying" type of script. 
It's simply a small script that works with my installer-NG which I like to use and which in my opinion makes the installation process of Arch Linux on your computer less obtrusive.

THIS SCRIPT INSTALLS MY DAILY PROGRAMS

Added programs from another text files for easy editing of programs.
This script installs from the aur using Paru. Some changes maybe needed to work with youe chosen aur helper





## Usage
If you just want to run the script, make sure you edit the top of the section of the script before running. 
you will need to mount the drive/usb you have the script on and simply run sh ./applications.sh




Please feel free to customize & tweak or even add your own custom tweaks, however these features require some basic knowledge of command line usage and shell scripting.

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR MACHINE. please read carefully and use your head.
